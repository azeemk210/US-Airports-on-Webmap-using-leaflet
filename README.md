## Abstract:

This project utilizes the Leaflet library to create an interactive web map displaying airports across the United States. Each airport is represented as a marker on the map, with a popup containing detailed information about the respective airport. The information provided in the popup includes essential data such as airport name, location, longitude, and latitude. Users can click on individual markers to access this information, enhancing their understanding of airport infrastructure and facilitating travel planning. Through the integration of Leaflet's mapping capabilities and dynamic popups, this project offers an intuitive and informative visualization of US airports accessible through a web browser.
